``Currently being re-built from scratch with a huge optimization. (All-in-one and Updater support.) At the moment in early development stages.``

## Note: plugin is currently in development phase, errors are to be expected.

`` You may NOT modify the plugin and distribute on to another place/source``

XStats is a Multi-Statistics tracking plugin.

### Featuring kill tracking, achievement tracking (module), session tracking, player connect/disconnect messages, player connect sounds, and even more to come. Aswell offers servers using unique Server ID's to read database tables, so you can have several tf2 servers for example using different server id's but still having same database tables.

`Aswell first statistical tracking plugin to support blinded and through smoke kill events on Counter-Strike: Source.`

### XStats is not made to supersede any statistical plugins, it's just made for fun and improving skills.

### Influenced by gameMe & HLStatsX:CE (Community driven HLStatsX version) 

## This is a 'plug-n-play' type of plugin. Throw the plugin into the server, add the neccessary database.cfg lines to connect to the database and You're done.
